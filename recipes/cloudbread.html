    <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
    <p>This is a recipe for a low-carb, gluten-free bread, also known as 'cloud bread,' which is a great base for sandwiches or pizza. In this recipe, the cloud breads are flavored with Italian herbs.</p>
    <p><h4>Ingredients</h5></p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs, separated</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Italian herb blend</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>
    <p><h4>Steps</h5></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Beat egg whites in a glass, metal, or ceramic bowl until foamy. Add baking powder and continue to beat until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg yolks, cream cheese, Italian herbs, and salt in a separate bowl until well blended.</li>
            <li>Gently fold cream cheese mixture into the beaten egg whites with a spatula until just mixed and yellow. Spoon mixture into about 6 rounds of about 3 inches diameter on the baking sheet. Smooth the tops with the back of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve warm, or allow to cool.</li>
        </ol>
